Predicting links in a citation network. 
The citation network is a graph G(V, E), where nodes represent scientific papers and a link between nodes u and v 
denotes that one of the papers cites the other. 
Each node in the graph contains some properties such as: 
the paper abstract, the year of publication and the author names. 

From the original citation network some randomly selected links have been deleted. 
Given a set of possible links, determination of the ones that appeared in the original network.
